Heart Disease Predictor — Project Description

This project aims to develop a machine learning–based application that predicts whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on their medical data. Using the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset from Kaggle, the system leverages Logistic Regression for binary classification.

The workflow involves several key stages:

Data Acquisition — Obtain the heart disease dataset from Kaggle.

Data Cleaning — Handle missing values, standardize numerical features, and encode categorical variables for model compatibility.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) — Visualize patterns and correlations in the dataset using histograms, heatmaps, and boxplots to understand feature importance.

Model Training — Apply Logistic Regression to train the model using a train-test split, ensuring proper generalization to unseen data.

Evaluation — Assess the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix to validate prediction quality.

Deployment — Integrate the trained model into an interactive Streamlit web app where users can input medical parameters and instantly get predictions.

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Streamlit.

Goal: To demonstrate how machine learning can assist in healthcare by providing an early prediction system for heart disease, potentially aiding in timely diagnosis and treatment.
